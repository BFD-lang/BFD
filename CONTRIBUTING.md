# Contributing to NitroPress

Thank you for wanting to contribute to **NitroPress** â€”  
a grammar-first, fullstack, no-JS web language built for clarity and structure.

This project is not just about code.  
Itâ€™s about reclaiming the joy of writing UI, logic, and data in one simple, readable grammar.  
Itâ€™s a movement toward structure, not scaffolding.

## ðŸ˜Š How You Can Help

We welcome contributions of all kinds:

### ðŸ§± Code & CLI
- Improve the core `nitro` CLI (written in Bun)
- Fix parser bugs or suggest grammar edge cases
- Add new DSL blocks (with a strong rationale)

### ðŸ§  Language & Grammar Design
- Propose syntax refinements that keep grammar readable
- Improve how `state:`, `stream:`, `server:` are parsed or composed
- Help us define what stays "in grammar" and what stays out

### ðŸ“¦ Examples & Docs
- Add example `.nitro` files (chat, dashboard, AI apps, etc)
- Improve the README or create mini-tutorials
- Translate docs or create local community guides

### ðŸ¤– LLM Integrations
- Build tools that convert `.nitro` files to/from JSON/AST
- Add support for prompt-aware agents
- Improve AI parsing / completion with NitroLang

## ðŸš€ Getting Started Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/nitropress.git
cd nitropress
bun install
bun run dev
```

You can test the CLI with:
```bash
bunx nitro init demo.nitro
bunx nitro build demo.nitro
```

## ðŸ“– Code Style

- Use **plain Bun (ESM)**, no TypeScript
- Keep everything minimal and readable
- Match the structure of `/parser`, `/cli`, and `/runtime`
- All new features must include a `.nitro` test example

## ðŸ“ƒ Grammar Philosophy

> NitroPress is not a framework. It is a grammar.

Please:
- Avoid clever abstractions that obscure readability
- Favor clarity over power
- Prioritize code that a **LLM could read or generate**
- Remember: this is for **humans first**, **machines second**

Feel free to open issues, start discussions, or just drop a `.nitro` idea.  
Letâ€™s build a new era of structure-first, AI-native, expressive web grammar â€” together.
