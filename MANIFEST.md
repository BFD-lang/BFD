# NitroPress Manifesto

> **NitroPress is not a framework.**  
> **It is a grammar â€” forged to reclaim the lost unity of the web.**

Where React fragmented.  
Where JSX obscured.  
Where tooling devoured time and intention.  
**We return to something simpler, more human, more expressive.**

We remember when building for the web meant opening a `.php` file and writing everything â€” HTML, logic, database, all in one place.  
We remember how Ruby made web apps feel like poetry, not ceremony.  
NitroPress revives that spirit â€” but reimagined with modern grammar, AI-native structure, and real-time capability.

## ðŸš§ What Broke the Web

Modern web development is broken.

- JSX divorced structure from HTML.
- State is managed in multiple locations, across useState, Redux, Context.
- APIs live outside the app, defined in Express or Next routes.
- DB schemas live in ORMs, away from code.
- LLMs cannot parse JSX, TSX, or hidden logic.

> We separated what was once unified.
> And we lost the ability to reason about an app as a whole.

## ðŸ›° What We Believe

- Code should be **readable**, not interpreted.
- Structure should be **expressed**, not composed.
- HTML is not legacy. It's the **native language of UI**.
- A full app should fit in **one grammar**.
- AI should be able to **read, write, and reason** with our code.

## âœ¨ What Makes NitroPress Different

| Concern     | NitroPress's Answer                             |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| UI          | `html:` blocks â€” declarative, natural            |
| Logic       | `state:`, `signal()`, `computed()`               |
| Composition | `island:` blocks, no props / components hell     |
| API         | `server:` blocks, no Express or Next required    |
| DB          | `db:` schema + `query:` in same grammar          |
| Real-time   | `stream:` for declarative socket-style updates   |
| LLMs        | Grammar-first, AST-friendly, indentation-based   |

## ðŸ’ª Built for Builders

> We built NitroPress not for engineers â€”  
but for **writers, thinkers, and structure designers**.

Anyone should be able to describe a full application in one `.nitro` file.

---

## ðŸ•Š Our Promise

- We will **never require** a build tool.
- We will **never introduce** JSX.
- We will always prefer **clarity over cleverness**.
- We will serve **human readability first, machine compatibility second**.
- We will remain **open, expressive, and light**.

## ðŸš– Join the Grammar Movement

This is not a framework war.  
This is the reclaiming of **grammar** as the foundation of the web.

Write the full web in one language.  
Not with plugins. Not with boilerplate.  
With **intention**. With **clarity**. With **NitroPress**.

**The next web isnâ€™t built. Itâ€™s described.**
