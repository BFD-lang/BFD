# ⚡️ Zap Philosophy

> "What if building an app felt like writing its story?"

Zap is built on one bold idea:

**🧠 Apps should be defined, not constructed.**

Most modern stacks are fragmented: frontend, backend, auth, storage, events — spread across frameworks, services, and dozens of files.

Zap says: define everything in one place. Use a single, human-readable DSL to declare what your app does.

No configuration. No infra decisions. Just **declare** your DB, API, auth, and events — and Zap brings them to life.

## 🌟 Core Principles

### 1. **Syntax is the Interface**

> Code is configuration. Make it beautiful.

The `zap.ts` file isn't just a config — it's the app itself. Clear, declarative, and close to natural thought.

### 2. **CLI First, UI Optional**

> Developers live in the terminal — so should your tools.

Zap prioritizes fast feedback, zero setup, and single-command results. GUI will follow, not lead.

### 3. **MVP-Centric Design**

> What can you launch this week, not next year?

Zap is for speed. MVPs, side projects, internal tools — deployable in minutes.

### 4. **Local-First, Cloud-Ready**

> Work offline. Go online when you want to scale.

Start with Bun + SQLite. Swap in Turso, D1, or any edge DB later. Zap works both ways.

### 5. **AI-Native by Design**

> Zap was made for GPT. Literally.

The syntax is minimal, typed, and predictable — so language models can help you write it, debug it, and extend it.

## 💬 Not Another BaaS

Zap is not a product. It’s a mindset:

- A new kind of framework
- A new layer of abstraction
- A new way to describe software

---

## 🧪 The Vision

> **“Zap is the language between idea and execution.”**

Write your app’s intention. Let Zap bring it to life. It’s that simple — and that radical.

Zap is what comes _after_ Firebase.
Zap is what comes _before_ code.

Zap is what happens when you stop building… and start defining.
